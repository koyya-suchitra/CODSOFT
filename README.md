## Data Science Internship Projects

During my internship at Codsoft, I worked on several projects that highlight my skills in data analysis and machine learning. Below is an in-depth overview of the key projects:

### Titanic Survival Prediction

**Objective:** Predict passenger survival on the Titanic by analyzing the Titanic dataset.

**Key Activities:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions, exploring relationships between features, and identifying key predictors of survival.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features based on domain knowledge, such as family size and ticket class.
- **Model Building:** Implementing various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using cross-validation, confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters using grid search and random search techniques to improve accuracy and generalization.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Movie Rating Prediction with Python

**Objective:** Develop a movie rating prediction system using Python.

**Key Phases:**
- **Data Collection:** Gathering movie ratings data from sources like the MovieLens dataset.
- **Data Analysis:** Understanding the distribution of ratings, user behavior, and movie popularity.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning data by handling missing values and duplicates, and normalizing rating scales.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting features such as user preferences, genre influence, and movie release year.
- **Model Building:** Implementing collaborative filtering techniques, including user-based and item-based filtering, as well as matrix factorization methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing models using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise library for recommender systems, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Iris Flower Classification

**Objective:** Classify iris flowers into different species based on sepal and petal measurements using the Iris dataset.

**Approach:**
- **Data Analysis:** Exploring the Iris dataset to understand the distribution of the different species and the relationships between features.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Standardizing features and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Building:** Implementing traditional machine learning algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using confusion matrices, accuracy scores, and cross-validation to assess model performance.
- **Visualization:** Creating visualizations such as scatter plots and decision boundaries to illustrate model predictions.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
